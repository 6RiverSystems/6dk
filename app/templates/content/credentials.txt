The 6RS REST APIs are programming language agnostic. As a WMS developer, you can use any one of your favorite programming languages to interface with our services over HTTPS. We also support transport over SFTP which is documented further in the development guide.

In production, we will send you BASIC auth credentials which you will use to authenticate into your personalized management console as well as 6RS web services. If you are using SFTP transport we will also send you server credentials to connect.
